Theoretical Background on Fair Machine Learning in Speech Emotion Recognition
1. Introduction to Bias in Speech Emotion Recognition
Speech emotion recognition (SER) is an important domain within affective computing that aims to identify emotional states from vocal expressions. However, like many machine learning applications, SER systems can exhibit bias, particularly with respect to protected attributes such as gender, age, or cultural background.
This report examines the theoretical foundations of algorithmic fairness in the context of speech emotion recognition, with a particular focus on gender bias. It supports the implementation provided in the accompanying code.
2. Sources of Bias in SER Systems
Bias in SER systems can emerge from multiple sources:
2.1 Data Collection Bias
Speech datasets may suffer from:

Demographic imbalance: Overrepresentation of certain genders, ages, or cultural backgrounds
Sampling bias: Data collection methods that systematically favor certain groups
Recording conditions: Variations in acoustic environments that correlate with demographic factors

2.2 Annotation Bias
Emotion labels can be influenced by:

Cultural differences in emotion expression and perception
Stereotypical expectations of how different genders express emotions
Annotator bias based on the demographics of the labelers

2.3 Feature Representation Bias
Common acoustic features like MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) can capture physiological differences between speakers:

Vocal tract differences: Biological differences in vocal anatomy between genders
Prosodic patterns: Cultural and social norms affecting speech patterns

2.4 Algorithmic Bias
Machine learning algorithms can amplify existing biases:

Statistical learning: Optimizing for overall accuracy can disadvantage minority groups
Feature importance: Algorithms may give undue weight to features that correlate with protected attributes

3. Fairness Metrics
To quantify and address bias, we employ several fairness metrics:
3.1 Disparate Impact (DI)
Disparate Impact measures the ratio of favorable outcomes between unprivileged and privileged groups:
DI=P(Y^=1∣D=unprivileged)P(Y^=1∣D=privileged)DI = \frac{P(\hat{Y}=1|D=\text{unprivileged})}{P(\hat{Y}=1|D=\text{privileged})}DI=P(Y^=1∣D=privileged)P(Y^=1∣D=unprivileged)​
Where:

$\hat{Y}$ is the predicted label
$D$ is the protected attribute (gender in our case)

A DI value of 1.0 indicates perfect fairness, while values below 0.8 are often considered legally problematic.
3.2 Equal Opportunity Difference (EOD)
Equal Opportunity Difference measures the difference in true positive rates between privileged and unprivileged groups:
EOD=P(Y^=1∣Y=1,D=privileged)−P(Y^=1∣Y=1,D=unprivileged)EOD = P(\hat{Y}=1|Y=1,D=\text{privileged}) - P(\hat{Y}=1|Y=1,D=\text{unprivileged})EOD=P(Y^=1∣Y=1,D=privileged)−P(Y^=1∣Y=1,D=unprivileged)
Where:

$Y$ is the true label

An EOD value of 0 indicates equal opportunity across groups.
4. Bias Mitigation Strategies
Our implementation explores two distinct bias mitigation techniques:
4.1 Prejudice Remover (In-processing)
Prejudice Remover is an in-processing technique that modifies the learning algorithm itself. It adds a regularization term to the objective function to penalize discrimination:
min⁡θL(X,Y,θ)+η⋅R(X,D,θ)\min_{\theta} L(X, Y, \theta) + \eta \cdot R(X, D, \theta)minθ​L(X,Y,θ)+η⋅R(X,D,θ)
Where:

$L$ is the original loss function
$R$ is a regularization term that penalizes correlation between predictions and protected attributes
$\eta$ is a hyperparameter controlling the fairness-accuracy trade-off

4.2 Reweighing (Pre-processing)
Reweighing is a pre-processing technique that assigns weights to training examples to ensure fairness. The weight assigned to each instance is:
w(y,d)=P(Y=y)⋅P(D=d)P(Y=y,D=d)⋅∣S∣w(y, d) = \frac{P(Y=y) \cdot P(D=d)}{P(Y=y, D=d) \cdot |S|}w(y,d)=P(Y=y,D=d)⋅∣S∣P(Y=y)⋅P(D=d)​
Where:

$y$ is the class label
$d$ is the value of the protected attribute
$|S|$ is the size of the training set

This approach upweights underrepresented combinations of class labels and protected attributes.
5. The Fairness-Accuracy Trade-off
A fundamental challenge in fair machine learning is balancing fairness and accuracy:

Strict fairness constraints may significantly reduce model performance
Maximizing accuracy often leads to discriminatory outcomes

The optimal balance depends on the specific application context and ethical considerations. Our implementation provides visualizations to help understand this trade-off.
6. Ethical Considerations in Speech Emotion Recognition
When developing fair SER systems, several ethical considerations are important:

Transparency: Clear documentation of fairness metrics and limitations
Contextual deployment: Understanding the social context in which the system operates
Ongoing monitoring: Regular auditing for emergent biases
Privacy concerns: Balancing fairness assessments with privacy protections

7. Conclusion
Fairness in speech emotion recognition is not merely a technical challenge but an ethical imperative. By implementing bias mitigation techniques and carefully measuring their impact, we can develop SER systems that provide more equitable treatment across demographic groups.
Our approach demonstrates how to quantify and mitigate gender bias in speech emotion recognition, providing a framework that can be extended to other protected attributes and domains.
